# RGB to Hex Converter

This is a simple C++ program that converts RGB color values to a hexadecimal color code. The program takes three inputs: the red, green, and blue components of the color (each ranging from 0 to 255) and outputs the corresponding hex color code.

## Features

- Converts RGB values to a hexadecimal color code.
- Validates that RGB inputs are within the correct range (0-255).
- Outputs the hex color code in the standard `#RRGGBB` format.

## How to Use

### Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

### Compilation

To compile the program, use the following command:

```bash
g++ -o rgb_to_hex rgb_to_hex.cpp
```

### Running the Program

After compiling, you can run the program with:

```bash
./rgb_to_hex
```

On Windows, run:

```cmd
rgb_to_hex.exe
```

### Example Usage

```bash
Enter Red (0-255): 255
Enter Green (0-255): 99
Enter Blue (0-255): 71
Hex Color Code: #FF6347
```
